Logistic regression applying on hearing test dataset
# project outline: 
This project uses logistic regression on a hearing test dataset downloaded from Kaggle. I used the following skills:
•	Data preprocessing
•	Data scaling
•	Data visualization
•	Logistic regression 
•	Scikit-learn
•	Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC, and precision recall curves
# Dataset:
•	Hearing test dataset collected from Kaggle
# Tools used: 
•	Python 
•	Pandas  
•	Matplotlib  
•	Seaborn
•	Scikit-learn
# Steps used in data analysis:
•	Data Loading:
Statistical analysis
Data  visualization
•	Data analysis:
Count plots
 Scatter plots
 Heatmaps
 Pair plots
Three-dimensional scatter plots
•	Data preprocessing:
Feature scaling with StandardScaler
•	Train model and evaluate it:
Logistic regression model
Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
ROC curve and precision-recall curve
# Summary (results):
•	Accuracy: ~92%
•	Precision: ~91%
•	Recall: ~96%
